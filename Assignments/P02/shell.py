        NAME
            ls - list directory contents

        SYNOPSIS
            ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

        DESCRIPTION
            List  information  about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor
            --sort is specified.

            Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

            -a, --all
                    do not ignore entries starting with .

            -h, --human-readable
                    with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.

            -l     use a long listing format

            The  SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or    
            KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

            The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FOR‐    
            MAT  is  FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed    
            with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the  default  style    
            to use.

            Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color    
            codes only when standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable  can  change  the  settings.    
            Use the dircolors command to set it.

        Exit status:
            0      if OK,

            1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

            2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

SYNOPSIS
    cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]

DESCRIPTION
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
    
    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.
    
    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.
    
    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

NAME
       sort - sort lines of text files

SYNOPSIS
       sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       sort [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

DESCRIPTION
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.  Ordering options:

       KEYDEF is F[.C][OPTS][,F[.C][OPTS]] for start and stop position, where F is a field number and C a character position in the    
       field; both are origin 1, and the stop position defaults to the line's end.  If neither -t nor -b is in  effect,  characters    
       in  a  field are counted from the beginning of the preceding whitespace.  OPTS is one or more single-letter ordering options    
       [bdfgiMhnRrV], which override global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire  line  as  the  key.    
       Use --debug to diagnose incorrect key usage.

       SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: % 1% of memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on for M, G, T,    
       P, E, Z, Y.

       *** WARNING *** The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort  order    
       that uses native byte values.

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches for PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints    
       each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in a shell command.

       A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is  given,  recursive  searches  examine  the  working  directory,  and    
       nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are the same as grep -E, grep -F, and grep -r, respectively.  These    
       variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.    
              Scanning each input file stops upon first match.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.   Regular  expressions  are  constructed  analogously  to    
       arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

       grep  understands  three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE) and “perl” (PCRE).    
       In  GNU  grep  there  is  no  difference  in  available  functionality  between  basic  and  extended  syntaxes.   In  other    
       implementations,  basic  regular  expressions  are  less  powerful.   The  following description applies to extended regular    
       expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.  Perl-compatible regular expressions  give    
       additional  functionality,  and  are  documented in B<pcresyntax>(3) and B<pcrepattern>(3), but work only if PCRE support is    
       enabled.

       The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.  Most characters,  including  all    
       letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-character with special meaning may be quoted by    
       preceding it with a backslash.

       The period . matches any single character.  It is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.

   Character Classes and Bracket Expressions
       A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ].  It matches any single character in  that  list.   If  the    
       first  character  of  the  list  is  the caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list; it is unspecified whether it    
       matches an encoding error.  For example, the regular expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.

       Within a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen.   It  matches  any  single    
       character  that  sorts  between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set.  For    
       example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort characters in dictionary order,  and  in    
       these  locales [a-d] is typically not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to [aBbCcDd], for example.  To obtain the    
       traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the LC_ALL  environment  variable  to    
       the value C.

       Finally,  certain  named  classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self    
       explanatory, and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:],    
       [:space:],  [:upper:],  and  [:xdigit:].   For  example, [[:alnum:]] means the character class of numbers and letters in the    
       current locale.  In the C locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z].  (Note that the brackets    
       in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket    
       expression.)  Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal ]  place  it    
       first in the list.  Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal - place it    
       last.

   Anchoring
       The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a    
       line.

   The Backslash Character and Special Expressions
       The  symbols  \<  and  \> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \b matches the    
       empty string at the edge of a word, and \B matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word.  The symbol  \w    
       is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].

   Repetition
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
       ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
       {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.
       {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.

   Concatenation
       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two    
       substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.

   Alternation
       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular expression matches any string  matching    
       either alternate expression.

   Precedence
       Repetition  takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be    
       enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.

   Back-references and Subexpressions
       The back-reference \n, where n is a single digit,  matches  the  substring  previously  matched  by  the  nth  parenthesized    
       subexpression of the regular expression.

   Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions
       In  basic  regular  expressions  the  meta-characters  ?,  +,  {,  |,  (,  and ) lose their special meaning; instead use the    
       backslashed versions \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).

EXIT STATUS
       Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error occurred.   However,  if    
       the -q or --quiet or --silent is used and a line is selected, the exit status is 0 even if an error occurred.

ENVIRONMENT
       The behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables.

       The  locale  for  category  LC_foo  is  specified by examining the three environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG, in that    
       order.  The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale.  For example, if LC_ALL is not set,  but  LC_MESSAGES    
       is set to pt_BR, then the Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the LC_MESSAGES category.  The C locale is used if none of    
       these environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not installed, or if  grep  was  not  compiled  with  national    
       language support (NLS).  The shell command locale -a lists locales that are currently available.

       GREP_COLOR
              This  variable  specifies  the  color  used  to  highlight  matched  (non-empty)  text.  It is deprecated in favor of    
              GREP_COLORS, but still supported.  The mt, ms, and mc capabilities of GREP_COLORS have priority over it.  It can only    
              specify  the  color  used  to highlight the matching non-empty text in any matching line (a selected line when the -v    
              command-line option is omitted, or a context line when -v is specified).  The default is 01;31, which  means  a  bold    
              red foreground text on the terminal's default background.

       GREP_COLORS
              Specifies  the  colors  and  other  attributes  used to highlight various parts of the output.  Its value is a colon-    
              separated list of capabilities that defaults to ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the rv and  ne    
              boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).  Supported capabilities are as follows.

              sl=    SGR  substring  for  whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted, or    
                     non-matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option    
                     are  both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's    
                     default color pair).

              cx=    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted, or    
                     matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option are    
                     both specified, it applies to selected non-matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's    
                     default color pair).

              rv     Boolean  value  that  reverses  (swaps)  the meanings of the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v command-line    
                     option is specified.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              mt=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line when the -v command-line    
                     option  is  omitted,  or a context line when -v is specified).  Setting this is equivalent to setting both ms=    
                     and mc= at once to the same value.  The  default  is  a  bold  red  text  foreground  over  the  current  line    
                     background.

              ms=01;31
                     SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty text in a selected line.  (This is only used when the -v command-line    
                     option is omitted.)  The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv) capability remains active when this kicks  in.   The    
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              mc=01;31
                     SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty  text in a context line.  (This is only used when the -v command-line    
                     option is specified.)  The effect of the cx= (or sl= if rv) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The    
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              fn=35  SGR  substring  for  file names prefixing any content line.  The default is a magenta text foreground over the    
                     terminal's default background.

              ln=32  SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line.  The default is a green text  foreground  over  the    
                     terminal's default background.

              bn=32  SGR  substring  for  byte offsets prefixing any content line.  The default is a green text foreground over the    
                     terminal's default background.

              se=36  SGR substring for separators that are inserted between selected line fields (:), between context line  fields,    
                     (-),  and between groups of adjacent lines when nonzero context is specified (--).  The default is a cyan text    
                     foreground over the terminal's default background.

              ne     Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (\33[K) each time  a    
                     colorized  item  ends.   This  is needed on terminals on which EL is not supported.  It is otherwise useful on    
                     terminals for which the back_color_erase (bce) boolean terminfo capability does not  apply,  when  the  chosen    
                     highlight colors do not affect the background, or when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.  The default    
                     is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no =... part.  They are omitted (i.e., false) by default  and  become  true  when    
              specified.

              See  the  Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that is used for permitted    
              values and their meaning as character attributes.  These substring values are integers in decimal representation  and    
              can  be  concatenated  with  semicolons.   grep  takes  care  of  assembling  the result into a complete SGR sequence    
              (\33[...m).  Common values to concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for blink, 7  for  inverse,  39  for    
              default  foreground  color,  30  to 37 for foreground colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors, 38;5;0 to    
              38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, 49 for default background color, 40 to 47 for background    
              colors,  100  to  107  for  16-color  mode background colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes    
              background colors.

       LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG
              These variables specify the locale for the LC_COLLATE category, which  determines  the  collating  sequence  used  to    
              interpret range expressions like [a-z].

       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
              These  variables  specify  the locale for the LC_CTYPE category, which determines the type of characters, e.g., which    
              characters are whitespace.  This category also determines the character encoding, that is, whether text is encoded in    
              UTF-8,  ASCII,  or  some  other  encoding.  In the C or POSIX locale, all characters are encoded as a single byte and    
              every byte is a valid character.

       LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG
              These variables specify the locale for the LC_MESSAGES category, which determines the language  that  grep  uses  for    
              messages.  The default C locale uses American English messages.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If  set,  grep  behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, grep behaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX requires that    
              options that follow file names must be treated as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the  front  of    
              the  operand  list  and  are  treated  as  options.   Also,  POSIX requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as    
              “illegal”, but since  they  are  not  really  against  the  law  the  default  is  to  diagnose  them  as  “invalid”.    
              POSIXLY_CORRECT also disables _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_, described below.

       _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_
              (Here  N  is  grep's  numeric  process  ID.)   If the ith character of this environment variable's value is 1, do not    
              consider the ith operand of grep to be an option, even if it appears to be one.  A shell can put this variable in the    
              environment  for  each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name wildcard expansion and    
              therefore should not be treated as options.  This behavior is available only with the GNU C library,  and  only  when    
              POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.

       are available.

   Known Bugs
       Large repetition counts in the {n,m} construct may cause grep to use lots of memory.  In  addition,  certain  other  obscure    
       regular expressions require exponential time and space, and may cause grep to run out of memory.

       Back-references are very slow, and may require exponential time.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  example outputs the location and contents of any line containing “f” and ending in “.c”, within all files in    
       the current directory whose names contain “g” and end in “.h”.  The -n option outputs line numbers, the --  argument  treats    
       expansions of “*g*.h” starting with “-” as file names not options, and the empty file /dev/null causes file names to be out‐    
       put even if only one file name happens to be of the form “*g*.h”.

         $ grep -n -- 'f.*\.c$' *g*.h /dev/null
         argmatch.h:1:/* definitions and prototypes for argmatch.c

       The only line that matches is line 1 of argmatch.h.  Note that the regular expression syntax used  in  the  pattern  differs    
       from the globbing syntax that the shell uses to match file names.

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directo‐    
       ries.

       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or  the  -r,  -R,  or  --recursive  are    
       given,  then  rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the    
       entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or  the  -i  or    
       --interactive=always  option  is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirma‐    
       tive, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
       -r
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       Note  that  if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise    
       and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

            [-# shift] [+[+]cmd] [--] [filename]...
       (See the OPTIONS section for alternate option syntax with long
       option names.)
DESCRIPTION         top
       Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
       movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less
       does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
       vi(1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it
       can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited support
       for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which
       should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a
       caret.)

       Commands are based on both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded
       by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The
       number is used by some commands, as indicated.
COMMANDS         top
       In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands
       for the ESCAPE key; for example ESC-v means the two character
       sequence "ESCAPE", then "v".

       Enter
              Scroll forward N lines, default one window (see option -z
              below).  If N is more than the screen size, only the final
              screenful is displayed.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a
              special literalization character.

SYNOPSIS         top

DESCRIPTION         top
       more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
       This version is especially primitive. Users should realize that
       less(1) provides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.
       
       COMMANDS         top
       Interactive commands for more are based on vi(1). Some commands
       may be preceded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions
       below. In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.

       ENTER
           Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen
           size.
    
        HISTORY         top
       The more command appeared in 3.0BSD. This man page documents more
       version 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the
       Linux community. Documentation was produced using several other
       versions of the man page, and extensive inspection of the source
       code.

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode,    
       which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit  pattern  for  the    
       new mode bits.

       The  format  of  a  symbolic  mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set    
       rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u),  other    
       users  in  the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).  If none of these are given, the    
       effect is as if (a) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

       The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them  to    
       be  removed;  and  = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned    
       set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or  search  for  directories)    
       (x),  execute/search  only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group    
       ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you  can  specify    
       exactly  one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other    
       users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding    
       categories (o).

       A  numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted dig‐    
       its are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted  dele‐    
       tion  or  sticky  (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2),    
       and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for    
       other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a    
       problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line,    
       chmod  changes  the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recur‐    
       sive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group  ID  or    
       one  of  the  user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause    
       the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality    
       of the underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

       For  directories  chmod preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or    
       clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s.  To clear these bits for directories with a numeric  mode  requires  an    
       additional leading zero, or leading = like 00755 , or =755

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories,    
       it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the  directory;    
       this  is  called  the  restricted  deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like    
       /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so  it  will  load    
       more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       By  default,  sparse  SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.    
       That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file  whenever  the  SOURCE    
       file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If    
       this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.   Use  --reflink=never    
       to ensure a standard copy is performed.

       The  backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via    
       the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the  same    
       name for an existing, regular file.
