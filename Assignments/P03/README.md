## CPU Scheduler Simulation
Algorithms implemented:
- First Come First Serve (fcfs.py) (done)
- Shortest Job First (sjb.py)
- Round Robin (rr.py)
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (mlfq.py) (in progress)

## Group Members:
- Brett Mitchell and Sly Rahimi

## Instructions:
- Receive jobs, burst types, and burst durations from 'cpu_jobs.py'.
- Choose First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Priority-Based (PB), or Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithm to run
- Run the simulation using 'sim.py' in the terminal, the entry point for simulations.
